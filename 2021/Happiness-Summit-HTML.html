                Loneliness has become an epidemic &mdash; a crisis deepened by
                the pandemic and its months of social isolation. But there are
                steps we can take to emerge from it. Dr. Vivek Murthy &mdash; US
                Surgeon General under both the Obama and Biden administrations
                and New York Times bestselling author of Together: The Healing
                Power of Human Connection &mdash; leads a critical exploration
                of social connection, and how we can use it to strengthen our
                health and our communities. Dr. Murthy examines how strong
                social ties and contributions to something bigger than ourselves
                have a direct impact on happiness, offering strategies each of
                us can begin using right now toward a happier and more connected
                life.

                Could the trillions of bacteria in the gut hold the key to our

                serotonin, the happy hormone, is produced in the gut, not the
